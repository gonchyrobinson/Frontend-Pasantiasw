# Cursor Rules for MUI MCP Integration

## Use the mui-mcp server to answer any MUI questions

- 1. call the "useMuiDocs" tool to fetch the docs of the package relevant in the question
- 2. call the "fetchDocs" tool to fetch any additional docs if needed using ONLY the URLs present in the returned content.
- 3. repeat steps 1-2 until you have fetched all relevant docs for the given question
- 4. use the fetched content to answer the question

## MCP Configuration

The MUI MCP server should be configured in your Cursor settings with:

```json
"mcp": {
  "servers": {
    "mui-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mui/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Material-UI Best Practices

- Use Material-UI components as the primary UI library
- Follow MUI's theming system with createTheme
- Use proper TypeScript types for all components
- Implement responsive design with Grid system
- Use sx prop for styling when possible
- Follow accessibility guidelines with proper ARIA attributes
- Use React Query for server state management
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
